This repository contains all scripts necessary to pre-process, and analyze body posture data. 

The data were provided by two adults (Example 1 and Example 2). Each adult provided data for two baseline and 2 test trials. The script kinect_procs_Step1-GitHub.R runs all pre-processing steps, and creates a .RData file which can be read in with kinect_procs_Step2-GitHub.R to run an example analysis. This analysis is run assuming Test 1 and Test 2 were recorded following different experimental treatments.
