# Kinect - body posture analysis

One Paragraph of project description goes here.

Contains all relevating scripts to run, process, and analyze posture data gathered from our Kinect-studies.
Each script is named after the current project it is used in and after the processing step it reflects in the overall process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Kinect-Prerequisites (Versions? Anschluss an PC, ...)

Licenses used by
  * the recording script:
    - Image Acquisition Toolbox
    - Matlab (Version?)
  * the processing script
    - Matlab (Version?)

In order to check if the Image Acquisition Toolbox is installed type the following code in the MATLAB command window.
```Matlab
license('test', 'Image_Acquisition_Toolbox')
```

The Processing Script runs in Windows and Mac OS, whereas the Recording Script only runs in Windows so far.

## Usage
The image below shows the processing GUI with all options to chose for processing the data.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. A chat room, an email address, etc.

Contact: robert.hepach@uni-leipzig.de

## Roadmap
list ideas for releases in the future.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

This script is part of an ongoing line of research and it is continuously updated. Those familiar with Matlab will notice redundancies in the code and room for improvement. You are, of course, free to make changes to the script for your own purposes but you do so at your own risk.
